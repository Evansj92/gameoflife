# GameOfLife

## Coding challenge based on Conways Game of Life

Assumptions & Comments
- Currently this iteration of the code only produces two evolutions and is rather simple, due to being sick with Covid for the past week and still recovering.
- Assuming a boundry of 10 by 10 for the field for inital rapid implementation as otherwise the box would be infinite.         
- Can develop multiple iterations of the code by moving the for loops and evolve calls into a function. 
- If a more rigorious and efficient implentation is required then a neighbour-by-neighbour approach would be better to determine
if each individual cells neighbour is alive or dead. This approach would identify the number of each alive neighbours as required.
